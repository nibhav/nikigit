  <h4>Definition:</h4>
  </div>
	 <div class="inf">
	<p>Traditional definitions of physical health prior to the onset of modern medicine would have considered someone
	physically healthy if he or she was not stricken with a serious illness. With modern medical innovations came longer
	life spans, which changed the way we define physical health. Today's definition can consider everything ranging from
	the absence of disease to fitness level.<p>
