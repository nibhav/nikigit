  <h5>In today’s world, it can be difficult keeping up with new research on what’s healthy and what isn’t, as it’s 
  changed over the years. In fact, if we were to make a list of things we should and shouldn’t do each day for improved health, 
  it would be overwhelming. The good news is that living a balanced, healthy lifestyle isn’t too difficult if a few key habits are formed.

 <p>A regulated sleep cycle with 7-9 hours of sleep per night is essential for mental and physical well-being.
 Sleep deprivation has several negative effects on mental and physical health.  It can lead to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, as well as significantly impair cognitive
 and motor performance. This can be remedied by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, 7-9 hours apart, give or take 30
 minutes before or after.  Achieving an optimal amount of sleep on a regular basis can also help normalize or improve weight and metabolism.</p>

  <p>3. Sweating It Out</p>
  </div>
  <div class="inf">
 <p>Elevating the heart rate for 20 minutes at a time each day is sufficient for reaping the rewards of this healthy habit. This could be a 
 brisk walk, run, bike ride, or hobby that involves physical activity. Whatever you decide to do each day, ensure it’s something enjoyable.
 Having an activity that you actually enjoy doing is more likely to stick, and if the same activity every day seems mundane, diversify fitness 
 efforts by switching up activities and routines throughout the week.</p>

  <p>4.Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate</p>
  </div>
  <div class="inf">
 <p>This is one of the most essential healthy habits as our bodies need water on a more consistent basis than food. Unfortunately, drinking the 
 right amount of water for one’s weight is one of the least practiced habits by most Americans. Consuming enough water not only helps hydrate and 
 nourish us, but it provides a neutral pH, helps detoxify organs, and combats food cravings. The good news is that the water in foods and even your 
 daily coffee count towards your daily intake.</p>

 <p>Studies show that being exposed to nature can actually change our mental health and thought process by increasing neural activity and cognitive
 function. It helps relieve stress, improves affect and focus, and provides mentally grounding benefits. Although many Americans work in urban areas
 with limited access to natural green space, you can achieve the same results by spending time in a local park or rooftop garden.  If you have more 
 flexibility in your schedule or location try taking a hike, going to the beach, and engaging in outdoor sports or activities.</p>

  <div class="inf">
 <p>Spending time with animals can have a positive impact on your mood and your health in many ways.For example, pet owners tend to have lower blood pressure
 and cholesterol levels, which relates to less stress and better heart health.

Having pets involves physical activity (ie: walking the dog, playing fetch, riding horses) which can increase your energy levels, as well as circulation.
 The fresh air and vitamin D through sun exposure don’t hurt either.  Pets also provide
 opportunities for socialization which leads to a sense of belonging and purpose, therefore decreasing risk of depression and loneliness.</p>

Mindfulness can be achieved by meditating, or focusing on being present in the here and now – without attention on the past or future. This heightened
 “state of awareness” provides benefits such as improved concentration and mental clarity, emotional intelligence, self-control, and an increased ability
 for acceptance and compassion.  All of which lead to a more positive and healthy state of mind.

These 7 healthy habits may seem difficult or even inconvenient to incorporate into your daily routine at first, but as simple or difficult as they
 seem, when put into practice they hold the power to positively transform the well-being of the body and mind, and your overall health.
